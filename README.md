# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow. It involves loading a dataset in Python, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning and transforming the data, analyzing it using SQL in MySQL Workbench, and finally building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to generate business insights.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills including data preprocessing, querying, visualization, and insight generation.

## 🔄 Project Steps
1. **Load Dataset**
   - Imported CSV data into Python using Pandas.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Checked data structure, summary statistics, and distributions.
   - Identified missing values and outliers.
   - Visualized trends and patterns using charts.

3. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Removed duplicates.
   - Converted data types.
   - Created new useful features/columns.

4. **SQL Analysis**
   - Loaded cleaned data into MySQL.
   - Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions such as:
     - Top-performing categories/products.
     - Monthly/seasonal trends.
     - Customer behavior analysis.
     - Revenue and growth metrics.

5. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Connected Power BI to the processed dataset.
   - Built interactive visuals and KPIs.
   - Added filters and slicers for dynamic analysis.
